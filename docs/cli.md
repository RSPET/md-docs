# CLI Commands

RSPET's server module provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to its user. This
part aims to introduce RSPET's CLI and detail the available commands.

The commands listed bellow are part of the [`essentials`](#essentials), the
[`files`](#files) and the [`udp`](#udp) plug-ins.

Feel free to ignore the "State(s)" and the "Transition" fields as the will rarely
be of use to an end user and are here purely to assist contributors and Plug-in
developers.
